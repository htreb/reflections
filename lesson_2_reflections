What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git creates a .git repository but puts nothing in it yet, that way when you save a commit you can leave your own commit note. you need to initialise one so you have a repository in the first place.





How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area is an inbetween area. the working directory is like the regular file folder which has your files. the repository is where git stores all the commits. you can put files into the staging area from the working area and then when you're happy you can make a commit of them and stuff them in the repository in one go. sort of like loading a hopper before dropping it into the furnice.
